## ML定义
### Introduction

Machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use of computers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasison proving conﬁdence intervals around these functions;

we therefore present the two central approaches to statistics:

- frequentist estimators  频率派估计
- Bayesian inference.     贝叶斯推断

Most machine learning algorithms can be divided into the categories of
- supervised  learning    监督学习
- unsupervised  learning  非监督学习

Most deep learning algorithms are based on an optimization algorithm called

- stochastic gradient  随机梯度下降

### E T P definition

what do we mean by learning?

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to someclass of tasksTand performance measureP, if its performance at tasks in T, asmeasured by P, improves with experience E.

E -> Data Set； supervised/unsupervised

T -> Function Set/Model； 回顾  分类  概率估计

P -> 准确率

O -> fitting
